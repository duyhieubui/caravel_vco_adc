# Overview

This project implements a VCO-Based ADC on skywater 130nm for IoT.

![VCO-based ADC Block Diagram](./docs/images/vco-adc-arch.png?raw=True "VCO-Based ADC Block Diagram")

The ADC Specification:

- Target bandwidth: <100KHz for speed recording or IoT sensor readout.
- First-order noise shaping Sigma-Delta Architecture
- Configurable oversampling rate up-to 1024
- VCO linear frequency range: 2-10MHz
- 11 delay cells & 11 phase readout
- 32-bit sin3 filtter

The VCO is designed using the full custom design flow. It uses a
special inverter which has been tuned such that the linear frequency
range from 2MHz to 10MHz.

The sin3 filter is used to provide the first-order noise shaping.

Except for the VCO, the rest of the design has been implemented using
the digital design flow.
